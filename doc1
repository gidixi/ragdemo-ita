“Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in Herefordshire.
The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr. John Turner, who made his
money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old country. One of the
farms which he held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was
also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the colonies, so that it
was not unnatural that when they came to settle down they should do so as near
each other as possible. Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became
his tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect equality, as they
were frequently together. McCarthy had one son, a lad of eighteen, and Turner
had an only daughter of the same age, but neither of them had wives living. They
appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to
have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of sport and were
frequently seen at the race-meetings of the neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two
servants—a man and a girl. Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen
at the least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families.
Now for the facts.
